# Sentience

## Installation

clone/download how you normaly would. After npm installing everything necessary (should just be 'npm install'), enter 'npm start' in your terminal at the base folder.

*you'll be npm installing electron for this app*

*I have not tested this out on Mac, but as far as I know everything should work*
